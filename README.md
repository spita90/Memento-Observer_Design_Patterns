# Memento-Observer_Design_Patterns

This toy software it's a simple implementation of a mix of Memento and Observer design patterns.

The program waits text input from the console (to be entered with the keyboard) and it will display it in a graphic text area.
This text area supports Undo and Redo actions, so you can go back and forth through the different text entered.

Memento will take care of the input text history, and Observer handles the graphic updates on text change.
